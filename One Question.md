David,\
As President Trump said, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg led an amazing life.

The President and Republicans were elected to make decisions on behalf of the American People, one of which is filling the vacancy on the United States Supreme Court.

There are only 44 days left until Election Day, and we only have one question for you, David:

**[Should President Trump nominate a Supreme Court Justice before the Election?](http://click.campaigns.rnchq.com/?qs=ed0cb5283c529a67df8167551ed6dbd5f330406399491c802dbcc1e336375c21d8b9f8367f6a0df01de34b400fc8fc343d0f74f0a7292bdc)**

President Trump wants to know where you stand right now, David.

This is our opportunity to put power back into the hands of every day Patriots, like YOU. This is where we Make America Great Again.

He'll look for your response in one hour.\
